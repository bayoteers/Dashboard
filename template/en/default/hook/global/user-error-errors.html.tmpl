[%# Note that error messages should generally be indented four spaces, like
  # below, because when Bugzilla translates an error message into plain
  # text, it takes four spaces off the beginning of the lines.

  # Note also that I prefixed my error name with "example", the name of my
  # extension, so that I wouldn't conflict with other error names in
  # Bugzilla or other extensions.
