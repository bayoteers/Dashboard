    Changes
======================

1.0 - The Dashboard extensions storage backend has been rewriten to use
    database. Old file based storage is not compatible with this, and currently
    there is no migration tools for existing overlays. Upgrading will not
    destroy the old overlays, but they won't be available in the new version.


    Dashboard
======================

Dashboard is an extension to Bugzilla reporting system. Unified
Dashboard-extension allows you to create and view versatile dashboard of
reports and graphs. Dashboard is versatile mash-up of numerous sources in
reporting system.

Dashboard-extension has the purpose of gathering valuable information from
reporting system into reports and graphs.


       Concepts
======================

Dashboards are arranged into 'overlays', these are a set of columns and widgets
with an associated name and description. An overlay may be shared with others,
or stored private to an individual user.

When Dashboard is opened, an empty 'workspace' overlay is created to contain
the user's changes until he explicitly saves the overlay with some name.

The act of opening an existing overlay actually clones it into this 'workspace'
overlay, where it remains again until the user explicitly saves it.

In this way, Dashboard can save any changes as the user makes them, without
risk of overwriting something it wasn't supposed to. If the user accidentally
(or willingly) closes the Dashboard tab, he can simply re-open the previous
'workspace' overlay' using the regular Open function.

This also allows the user to open multiple dashboards in tabs, and make changes
to them, without the changes conflicting with each other.


       Widgets
======================

Widgets represent the basic unit of information in a dashboard. Various widget
types are provided by default, for embedding a URL in an IFRAME, viewing RSS
feeds, holding plain text, or listing Bugzila bugs.

Each widget has an associated dialog that allows changing its settings.

Widgets may be drag'n'dropped between columns, or dragged to change their
height.


    INSTALLATION
======================

Install extension by extracting files from archive. Switch to 'extension'
directory below Bugzilla root directory and extract files from archive.
